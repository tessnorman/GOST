# Python Scripts
### Tools and scripts written in Python
The python scripts are organized by topic. Some of the topics might have related scripts in different languages. For example, the first bit of geoprocessing could be done in Python and the second bit in Stata. If this is the case, it will be indicated in the readme.md files for easy navigation.
