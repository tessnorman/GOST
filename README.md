# Data processing scripts
### Tools and scripts for the GOST team
This repository contains a number of commonly used scripts for processing geospatial and non-geospatial data written by Therese Norman and colleagues. Many of the scripts are written for the World Bank's Geospatial Operations Support Team (GOST). The repo is structured by the language of the processing code first and then by topic.
